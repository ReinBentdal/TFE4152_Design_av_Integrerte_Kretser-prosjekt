# TFE4152 - Design of Integrated Circuits Curriculum

## Book: Analog Integrated Circuit Design
Authors: Carusone, Tony Chan Johns, David Martin, Kenneth [at akademia.no](https://www.akademika.no/analog-integrated-circuit-design/carusone-tony-chan/johns-david/martin-kenneth/9781118092330)

This is one of the best books in
existence on analog integrated circuit design, maybe rivaled by Razavi's [Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Analog-CMOS-Integrated-Circuits/dp/0072380322)

All information in chapters 1 - 3 are part of the curriculum for the written exam.

This book provides a view into integrated circuits from the digital perspective.
Some of the topics overlap with CJM (Carusone, Johns, Martin), however, the
digital perspective is useful.

The table below shows the excluded sections of the book, in other words, those
sections that are **not** part of the curriculum for the written exam.
